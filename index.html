			NEW YORK, Nov. 23, 2021 - From being brought up at community board meetings to Facebook posts criticizing it, the issue of child abuse and neglect in Jamaica, Queens, has been a forefront issue for the community’s residents for months.
		</p>
		<p>
			According to the state of New York, child abuse and neglect refers to the “failure to act, by any parent or caretaker that results in the death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse, or exploitation of a child under the age of 18.” A tracking of child abuse and neglect across the state of New York from 2015 to 2020, through  <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Abuse-Neglect-by-Community-District-CD-/rnjn-x48k">data from the Administration for Children's Services (ACS)</a>, shows the rates of child abuse in Jamaica to be the highest in its borough of Queens and in the entire state of New York.

			Audace Garnett is a youth and domestic violence specialist and resident of Jamaica who started Auscenscion Advocacy and Counseling in an effort to provide community outreach aimed at preventing abuse and neglect in communities of color.
		</p>
		<p>
			“I started this to empower the youth,” Garnett said. “I understand the barriers young people living on the margins face and I believe in honoring those experiences. They are capable of making decisions around their well-being, safety, and future if they are only provided with the proper tools and support to navigate their experiences.”
		</p>
		<p>
			Although some residents have been complaining about the rates of neglect, research shows these rates as reducing across all boroughs. According to data collected by the ACS, the amount of child neglect cases reported in 2020 is much lower than it was in 2015.
		</p>
		<p>
			Garnett says, while child neglect and abuse can be seen as reducing across all five boroughs, the numbers are still quite high; and for Jamaica, the issue lies in the lack of acknowledgment.
		</p>
		<p>
			“There is a lot of denial,” Garnett said. “There isn’t enough of a realization that this is of concern. I just hope the community can wake up.”

			While residents of Jamaica try to find ways to combat and bring awareness to child abuse, Garnett says the solution lies in the voices of the ones being harmed.
		</p>
		<p>
			“It’s all about awareness,” Garnett said. “I believe there is an ongoing need for youth voices to be at the forefront. As well as a need for us to create survivor-centered, youth allyship within every institution.”
